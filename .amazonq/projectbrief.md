# Neovim Configuration Project Brief

## Project Overview

This is a personal Neovim configuration repository focused on creating a modern, efficient development environment optimized for DevOps, infrastructure, and software development workflows.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
- **Fast Startup**: Optimized for quick startup times (target <40ms)
- **DevOps Focus**: Strong support for Terraform, Docker, YAML, and infrastructure tools
- **Modern Development**: Support for Python, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, and other languages
- **Productivity**: Efficient navigation, search, and file management
- **Integration**: Seamless tmux integration and terminal workflow

### Key Features Required
- LSP integration with comprehensive language support
- Fuzzy finding and search capabilities

## Target Users

**Primary User**: Senior DevOps Engineer/Infrastructure Developer
- Works with multiple programming languages
- Heavy Terraform and infrastructure code usage
- Requires fast, efficient editing workflows
- Uses tmux for terminal multiplexing
- Needs integrated debugging and database tools

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance**: Startup time under 40ms with lazy loading
2. **Functionality**: All essential development tools available
3. **Reliability**: Stable configuration with error handling
4. **Maintainability**: Clean, modular plugin architecture
5. **Usability**: Intuitive keybindings and discoverable features

## Technical Constraints
