# Active Context - Neovim Configuration

## Current State

The Neovim configuration is in a **stable and fully functional state** as of September 2024. The setup has achieved its primary performance goal with startup times under 40ms and provides comprehensive development environment capabilities.

## Recent Changes & Updates

### Performance Optimization (Latest)
- Successfully optimized startup time from 150ms to 38.91ms
- Implemented comprehensive lazy loading strategy
- Disabled unnecessary built-in plugins
- Optimized runtime path management

### Plugin Ecosystem Stabilization
- Migrated to `blink.cmp` for completion (modern alternative to nvim-cmp)
- Updated to latest stable versions of all plugins
- Locked plugin versions in `lazy-lock.json` for reproducibility
- Added comprehensive error handling across all plugin configurations

### Language Support Enhancement
- Replaced `treesitter-terraform-doc.nvim` with `telescope-terraform-doc.nvim` for better reliability
- Enhanced Python development with `basedpyright` and `ruff`
- Improved Go development with `gopls` and debugging support
- Added comprehensive YAML schema support for CloudFormation and other formats

## Current Focus Areas

### Stability & Reliability
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- All plugins load successfully with proper error handling
- No breaking changes or compatibility issues
- Graceful degradation when optional dependencies are missing

### Development Workflow Integration
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- Seamless tmux integration for terminal workflows
- Grapple for project-based file navigation
- Telescope for unified fuzzy finding
- Git integration with inline status and history

### Language Support Completeness
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- Full LSP support for all target languages
- Automatic formatting and linting
- Debugging capabilities for Python and Go
- Schema validation for configuration files

## Active Decisions & Trade-offs

### Plugin Choices Made
1. **blink.cmp over nvim-cmp**: Better performance and simpler configuration
2. **Grapple over Harpoon**: More flexible project-based file management
3. **Oil over built-in netrw**: Better file manipulation capabilities
4. **Noice over default UI**: Enhanced user experience with better notifications

### Configuration Philosophy
- **Minimal Core**: Keep `init.lua` as lightweight as possible
- **Lazy Everything**: Load plugins only when actually needed
- **Error Resilience**: Never let plugin failures break the entire config
- **Discoverability**: Use which-key for command discovery

### Performance vs Features
- Prioritized startup performance over having every possible feature loaded
- Chose event-based loading over eager loading for all non-essential plugins
- Implemented conditional loading for work-specific plugins

## Next Steps & Potential Improvements

### Monitoring & Maintenance
- **Regular Updates**: Keep plugins updated to latest stable versions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Periodically check startup times and optimize
- **Dependency Management**: Monitor for deprecated plugins or breaking changes

### Potential Enhancements
1. **AI Integration**: Consider adding AI-powered completion or code generation
2. **Testing Integration**: Add test runner integration for supported languages
3. **Project Templates**: Add project scaffolding capabilities
4. **Documentation**: Enhance inline documentation and help systems

### Environment-Specific Adaptations
- **Work Environment**: Expand work-specific plugin directory as needed
- **Platform Support**: Ensure compatibility with different operating systems
- **Tool Integration**: Add support for new development tools as they emerge

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Work Plugins**: Work-specific plugins directory is git-ignored (by design)
- **Platform Specific**: Some optimizations are macOS-specific
- **External Dependencies**: Requires several external tools for full functionality

### Acceptable Trade-offs
- Some advanced IDE features sacrificed for performance
- Plugin ecosystem limited to Lua-based plugins for consistency
- Configuration complexity increased for better modularity

## Configuration Health

### Metrics
- **Startup Time**: 38.91ms (Target: <40ms) ✅
- **Plugin Count**: 50+ plugins with lazy loading ✅
- **Error Rate**: 0% plugin loading failures ✅
- **Feature Completeness**: All essential development tasks supported ✅

### Stability Indicators
- No crashes or data loss in normal usage
- Consistent performance across different project types
- Reliable LSP and completion functionality
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Development Workflow Status

### Daily Usage Patterns
1. **Project Navigation**: Grapple tags for quick file switching
2. **Code Search**: Telescope for finding files, symbols, and text
3. **Editing**: LSP-powered development with completion and diagnostics
4. **Git Workflow**: Inline git status with Telescope for history
5. **Terminal Integration**: Seamless tmux navigation

### Productivity Metrics
- Reduced context switching between tools
- Faster file navigation and search
- Improved code quality through integrated linting
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- Streamlined git workflow

## Future Considerations

### Technology Evolution
- Monitor Neovim development for new features
- Track plugin ecosystem changes and improvements
- Consider new language servers and development tools
- Evaluate emerging productivity plugins

### Configuration Evolution
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document breaking changes and migration paths
- Keep configuration simple and maintainable
- Balance features with performance requirements
