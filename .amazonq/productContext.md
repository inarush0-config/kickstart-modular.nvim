# Product Context - Neovim Configuration

## Why This Project Exists

This Neovim configuration exists to provide a highly optimized, modern development environment that addresses the specific needs of infrastructure and software development workflows. It solves the problem of having a fragmented toolchain by integrating all essential development tools into a single, cohesive editor experience.

## Problems It Solves

### Development Efficiency
- **Slow Editor Startup**: Traditional IDE startup times can be 5-10+ seconds
- **Context Switching**: Jumping between multiple tools for different tasks
- **Configuration Complexity**: Managing multiple tool configurations separately
- **Inconsistent Experience**: Different interfaces and keybindings across tools

### Infrastructure Development Needs
- **Terraform Workflow**: Integrated documentation, formatting, and validation
- **Multi-Language Support**: Seamless switching between Python, Go, YAML, JSON, etc.
- **File Management**: Efficient navigation of complex project structures
- **Git Integration**: Inline git status, blame, and history viewing

### Terminal Integration
- **Tmux Workflow**: Seamless navigation between editor and terminal panes
- **Database Access**: Direct database querying from the editor
- **Command Execution**: Integrated terminal and command execution

## User Experience Goals

### Speed and Responsiveness
- Sub-40ms startup time for immediate productivity
- Lazy loading to minimize initial resource usage
- Fast file searching and navigation
- Responsive LSP and completion

### Discoverability
- Which-key integration for command discovery
- Consistent keybinding patterns
- Visual feedback and notifications
- Comprehensive help system

### Workflow Integration
- Grapple for quick file switching within projects
- Telescope for fuzzy finding everything
- Neo-tree for project structure visualization
- Oil for direct file system manipulation

### Visual Experience
- Gruvbox theme for comfortable long-term use
- Proper syntax highlighting for all supported languages
- Git status indicators in the gutter
- Contextual information display

## Target Workflows

### Infrastructure Development
1. Open project with Grapple tags for quick navigation
2. Edit Terraform files with LSP support and documentation
3. Format and validate on save
4. View git changes inline
5. Test and debug infrastructure code

### Software Development
1. Navigate large codebases with Telescope
2. Use LSP for code intelligence and refactoring
3. Debug applications with integrated DAP
4. Manage database connections and queries
5. Format and lint code automatically

### Configuration Management
1. Edit dotfiles with chezmoi integration
2. Manage YAML configurations with schema validation
3. Work with Docker files and compose configurations
4. Handle various configuration formats (JSON, TOML, etc.)

## Success Metrics

- **Startup Performance**: Consistently under 40ms startup time
- **Feature Completeness**: All essential development tasks possible within editor
- **Reliability**: No crashes or data loss during normal usage
- **Maintainability**: Easy to add new plugins and modify configuration
- **User Satisfaction**: Improved productivity compared to previous setup
